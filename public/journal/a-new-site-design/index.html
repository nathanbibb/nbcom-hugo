    <p>While the rest of the world is worrying about the COVID-19 global pandemic,
I decided to do a third redesign of my personal website.</p>
<h2 id="migration-to-google-cloud-storage">Migration to Google Cloud Storage</h2>
<p>I decided a few years ago I wanted to stop paying hosting fees.  Several places
had emerged where I could host for free or almost free.  I played around with
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a> and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/">GCP</a>.  Each
had free tiers where I could learn.  I ended up moving my hosting to
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage">Google Cloud Storage</a> since there is a
permanent free tier and it tied in with my overall Google account.</p>
<p>While I was researching cloud hosts, I realized my current site was embarrasing.
I hadn&rsquo;t updated the thing in 8 years.  It was looking pretty shabby.</p>
<h2 id="static-site-generation-with-hugo">Static Site Generation with Hugo</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been interested in static site generators since before I did my last
redesign.  It always felt like having a full database (such as
<a href="https://wordpress.com/">Wordpress</a>) for my dinky blog was overkill.  When I did
my last redesign (in 2012 or so), I ended up going with a perl-based system
called <a href="http://blosxom.sourceforge.net/">Blosxom</a>.  I think Blosxom was one of
the first, if not THE first, static site generators.</p>
<p>Since then, the number of static site generators has blown up.  Now
they have a cool new name (<a href="https://jamstack.org/">JAMstack</a>).  When I was
looking to get off my hosting provider, I looked at several static site
generators and landed on <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extensive library of decent looking templates</li>
<li>Distributed as a single executable (<a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>,
for instance, requires a Ruby environment to be set up)</li>
<li>Written in <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a>, which I don&rsquo;t know but I&rsquo;m interested
in.  I only know <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>, and the only static
site generator that I found using Python is
<a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a>, but their templates are not great.</li>
</ul>
<p>So now I have a site up, generated with Hugo, hosted on the Google Cloud for
free.  Woot.</p>
