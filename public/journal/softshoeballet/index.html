    <p>After much hemming and hawing, I&rsquo;ve decided to throw an old recording I did 20+ years ago on Bandcamp.  The link should be on the front page of this site.  The name of the recording is <a href="https://nathanbibb.bandcamp.com/album/softshoeballet">Softshoeballet</a>.</p>

<p>A little about the piece:</p>
<p>I started on what would become Softshoeballet in the summer of 1999 when I moved from Atlanta to Brooklyn.  The name derives from a piece of art by Stacy Hand.  The piece consists of field recordings taken in New York and Chuluota, FL, as well as guitar and keyboard (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korg_DSS-1">Korg DSS-1</a>).  Field recordings were done on a Sharp Minidisc recorder, and the overall piece was put together on a Yamaha MT120 4-track cassette recorder.  Recording was completed in April 2000.  Remixing and Mastering was done 2020-2021 in <a href="https://ardour.org/">Ardour</a>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, most of the keyboard parts were made from glitches in the sampling process (it was Korg&rsquo;s first, and for a long time only, sampling keyboard, using an old fashioned floppy disk drive), so they will never again be duplicated in all likelyhood.</p>
<p>There are a few other recordings from the past 20+ years I need to clean up, so hopefully I&rsquo;ll continue posting new things as I get around to them.</p>
