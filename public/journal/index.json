        "body": "While the rest of the world is worrying about the COVID-19 global pandemic, I decided to do a third redesign of my personal website.\nMigration to Google Cloud Storage The motivation to change my site came from my desire to stop paying hosting fees. As part of researching how I would transition to a cloud host, I was forced to look at my current site. It was embarrasing that I hadn\u0026rsquo;t made a site update in 8 years. Things were looking pretty old.\nI ended up moving my hosting to Google Cloud Storage since there is a permanent free tier that I felt I could fit into.\nStatic Site Generation with Hugo I\u0026rsquo;ve been interested in what are now called static site generators from almost the very beginning of their existence. My main motivation was that it felt like having a full database for my dinky blog was overkill. At the time, I ended up going with a perl-based system called Blosxom.\nSince I last redesigned my site using Blosxom (in 2012 or so), the environment of static site generators has blown up. When I was looking to get off my hosting provider, I looked at several static site generators and landed on Hugo for the following reasons:\n Extensive library of decent looking templates Distributed as a single executable (Jekyll, for instance, requires a Ruby environment to be set up) Written in Go, which I don\u0026rsquo;t know but I\u0026rsquo;m interested in. I only know Python, and the only static site generator that I found using Python is Pelican, but their templates are not great.  So now I have a site up, generated with Hugo, hosted on the Google Cloud for free. Woot.\n"
