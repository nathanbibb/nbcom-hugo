    <p>During this whole COVID crisis, I&rsquo;ve been attending a lot more virtual meetings
for personal reasons that I ever have in my life.  While I was able to attend
these meetings with my trust NUC desktop computer, I felt the need once again
to have a decent laptop for this and other reasons.</p>
<p>I purchased my last laptop in 2013, and I honestly didn&rsquo;t think I would ever
get a new laptop.  But a company called <a href="https://system76.com/">System76</a>
recently came out with a new computer that seemed to be exactly what I wanted,
so I blew my stimulus money on a new machine.  I do not regret it at all.</p>
<p>There are a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=lemur+pro+review">ton of reviews</a>
of the System76 Lemur Pro, so I&rsquo;m not going to review it here or anything.
However, I will provide some links to accessories that work well with it.  One
of the things I didn&rsquo;t want to give up is my multiple monitor setup.  Since the
Lemur Pro has a USB-C port that supports Display Port, so it should be supported
by a USB-C hub, but the whole world of USB-C is a confusing mess right now.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s what I used that worked:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://system76.com/laptops/lemur">Lemur Pro</a>: I ordered mine with minimum
RAM and a 250GB NVMe drive for the OS, no second drive.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07QNRM45T/">Hiearcool USB-C Hub</a>: I was
prepared to return it if it didn&rsquo;t work, but it doesn the job, hooking up
2 monitors (HDMI and/or VGA), USB-3 external drives, Ethernet, and power.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07Z7WB3MK">USB-C Power Supply</a>: Works
fine hooked up to the Hiearcool hub.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07KK9QXPM">USB-C Extender</a>: The one
complaint I have about the Hiearcool Hub is it has a short cord to the
laptop that is attached to the hub.  This extender allows me to attach the
hub to the underside of my desk and hide away the mess.</li>
</ul>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what works for me.  I should probably post this on reddit so someone
actually sees it.</p>
