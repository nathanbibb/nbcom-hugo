During this whole COVID crisis, I've been attending more virtual meetings
for personal reasons than I ever.  I was able to attend these meetings with my
NUC desktop computer, but I felt the need once again
to have a decent laptop.

I purchased my last laptop in 2013, and I honestly didn't think I would ever
get a new one.  But a company called [System76](https://system76.com/)
recently came out with a model that seemed to be exactly what I wanted,
so I blew my stimulus money on a new machine.  I do not regret it at all.

There are a [ton of reviews](https://www.google.com/search?q=lemur+pro+review)
of the [Lemur Pro](https://system76.com/laptops/lemur), so I'm not going to
review it here or anything. However, I will provide some links to accessories
that work well with it.

I didn't want to give up my multiple monitor setup, and the Lemur Pro's USB-C
Display Port supports multiple monitors with the right hub.  Here's what I used
that worked:

- [Hiearcool USB-C Hub](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07QNRM45T/): I was
    prepared to return it if it didn't work, but it doesn the job, hooking up
    2 monitors (HDMI and/or VGA), USB-3 external drives, Ethernet, and power.
- [USB-C Power Supply](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07Z7WB3MK): Works
    fine hooked up to the Hiearcool hub.
- [USB-C Extender](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07KK9QXPM): The one
    complaint I have about the Hiearcool Hub is it has a short cord to the
    laptop.  This extender allows me to extend the cord by 6 feet for better
    cable management.  I am only pushing 2 1080p monitors, so not sure how this
    will work if you are trying to use 4k.
