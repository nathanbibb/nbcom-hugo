During this whole COVID crisis, I've been attending a lot more virtual meetings
for personal reasons that I ever have in my life.  While I was able to attend
these meetings with my trust NUC desktop computer, I felt the need once again
to have a decent laptop for this and other reasons.
<!--more-->

I purchased my last laptop in 2013, and I honestly didn't think I would ever
get a new laptop.  But a company called [System76](https://system76.com/)
recently came out with a new computer that seemed to be exactly what I wanted,
so I blew my stimulus money on a new machine.  I do not regret it at all.

There are a [ton of reviews](https://www.google.com/search?q=lemur+pro+review)
of the System76 Lemur Pro, so I'm not going to review it here or anything.
However, I will provide some links to accessories that work well with it.  One
of the things I didn't want to give up is my multiple monitor setup.  Since the
Lemur Pro has a USB-C port that supports Display Port, so it should be supported
by a USB-C hub, but the whole world of USB-C is a confusing mess right now.

So here's what I used that worked:

- [Lemur Pro](https://system76.com/laptops/lemur): I ordered mine with minimum
    RAM and a 250GB NVMe drive for the OS, no second drive.
- [Hiearcool USB-C Hub](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07QNRM45T/): I was
    prepared to return it if it didn't work, but it doesn the job, hooking up
    2 monitors (HDMI and/or VGA), USB-3 external drives, Ethernet, and power.
- [USB-C Power Supply](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07Z7WB3MK): Works
    fine hooked up to the Hiearcool hub.
- [USB-C Extender](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07KK9QXPM): The one
    complaint I have about the Hiearcool Hub is it has a short cord to the
    laptop that is attached to the hub.  This extender allows me to attach the
    hub to the underside of my desk and hide away the mess.

So that's what works for me.  I should probably post this on reddit so someone
actually sees it.
