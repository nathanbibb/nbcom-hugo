After much hemming and hawing, I've decided to throw an old recording I did 20+ years ago on Bandcamp.  The link should be on the front page of this site.  The name of the recording is [Softshoeballet](https://nathanbibb.bandcamp.com/album/softshoeballet).

I'll probably link to it on Facebook, Instagram, etc.  If you find your way to this page and want a free promo code to download it for free, shoot me an email.

A little about the piece:

I started on what would become Softshoeballet in the summer of 1999 when I moved from Atlanta to Brooklyn.  The name derives from a piece of art by Stacy Hand.  The piece consists of field recordings taken in New York and Chuluota, FL, as well as guitar and keyboard ([Korg DSS-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korg_DSS-1)).  Field recordings were done on a Sharp Minidisc recorder, and the overall piece was put together on a Yamaha MT120 4-track cassette recorder.  Recording was completed in April 2000.  Remixing and Mastering was done 2020-2021 in [Ardour](https://ardour.org/).

Interestingly, most of the keyboard parts were made from glitches in the sampling process (it was Korg's first, and for a long time only, sampling keyboard, using an old fashioned floppy disk drive), so they will never again be duplicated in all likelyhood.

There are a few other recordings from the past 20+ years I need to clean up, so hopefully I'll continue posting new things as I get around to them.
