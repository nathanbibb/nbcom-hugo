To correct the front page a little, I work for a giant consulting congolomerate
that has a smaller division that sells software to insurance companies.  You
can see more details about my work life on my

## About nathanbibb.com

I was sure to buy nathanbibb.com early in the internet gold rush.  At the time,
I wanted to keep and maintain a "blog".  I did for a few years, but then life
got in the way.  Plus, nowadays having a "blog" seems very "15-years-ago".

Having one's own site seemed like a great thing to do back when I started
in 2004.  Now it seems there is a third party platform for everything you might
want to do online - post pictures on Instagram, personal thoughts on Twitter
and Facebook, articles on Medium, music on Bandcamp, etc. etc.

So I'm leaving what I do here open ended.
